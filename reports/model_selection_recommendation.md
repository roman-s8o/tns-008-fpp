# Model Selection Recommendation

**Date**: 2025-10-15

**Milestone**: 12 - SSL Validation

---

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive evaluation of three SSL pre-trained FinBERT models, **FinBERT Contrastive** is recommended for downstream fine-tuning tasks.

## üéØ Recommended Model

### FinBERT Contrastive

**Model Path**: `data/models/finbert_contrastive`

**Key Strengths**:

- ‚úÖ **Excellent Representations**: Specialized for embedding quality
- ‚úÖ **Contrastive Learning**: Optimized for similarity-based tasks

**Performance Summary**:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Overall Score | 1.0710 (Rank 1/3) |
| Contrastive Loss | 1.9459 |
| Throughput | 62.62 samples/sec |

## üìä Comparison with Alternatives

### 2. FinBERT MLM

**Overall Score**: 1.3651 (+27.5% vs. best)

**Strengths**:

**Limitations**:
- Lacks explicit contrastive learning objective
- Lower overall performance compared to FinBERT Contrastive

### 3. FinBERT Multi-task

**Overall Score**: 2.1317 (+99.0% vs. best)

**Strengths**:

**Limitations**:
- Lower overall performance compared to FinBERT Contrastive

## üíº Recommended Use Cases

The **FinBERT Contrastive** model is well-suited for:

1. **Financial Text Classification**
   - Sentiment analysis on financial news
   - Market direction prediction
   - Risk assessment

2. **Sequence-to-Label Tasks**
   - Stock price movement prediction
   - Event detection in financial documents
   - Named entity recognition

3. **Embedding-Based Applications**
   - Document similarity
   - Clustering financial articles
   - Information retrieval

## üîÑ Ensemble Strategy (Optional)

While the recommended model performs best individually, an ensemble approach could be considered:

**Potential Ensemble Configuration**:
- **Primary Model**: Multi-task (for balanced predictions)
- **Specialist Model**: MLM (for language-heavy tasks)
- **Specialist Model**: Contrastive (for similarity-based tasks)

**When to Use Ensemble**:
- Critical production applications requiring highest accuracy
- When computational resources allow for multiple model inference
- Tasks requiring both strong language understanding and representation quality

**Ensemble Strategy**:
- Weighted averaging: 50% Multi-task, 30% MLM, 20% Contrastive
- Voting mechanism for classification tasks
- Embedding concatenation for downstream models

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Next Steps

1. **Proceed to Milestone 13**: Feature Extraction (Sentiment)
2. **Use FinBERT Contrastive model** for feature extraction
3. **Fine-tune** the selected model on downstream tasks
4. **Monitor performance** on real-world financial prediction tasks
5. **Consider ensemble** if single-model performance is insufficient

## üé¨ Conclusion

The **FinBERT Contrastive** model represents the optimal choice for downstream fine-tuning in the SSL-based financial prediction platform. 

**Recommendation**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED for Production Use**
